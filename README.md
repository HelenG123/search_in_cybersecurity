When developing software, building a reliable and robust user interface (UI) that is
not susceptible to system crashes is a key objective. However, testing and handling 
all the possible user interactions and inputs can be difficult to do, especially 
when it is not automated. An effective and popular automated quality assurance test 
used for detecting coding errors and vulnerabilities with random input is fuzz testing. 

Taking inspiration from gremlin.js and MonkeyTestIt, I create my own fuzzer LilFuzz!
